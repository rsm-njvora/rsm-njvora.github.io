        "Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the _American Economic Review_ in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the [AEA website](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.97.5.1774) and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of [Harvard's Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/27853&version=4.2). \n",
        "\n",
        "_to do: Participants were split into a **control group** and a **treatment group**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Control group**: Received a standard letter with no mention of a match.\n",
        "- **Treatment group**: Received a letter stating that a \"concerned fellow member\" would match their donation. These individuals were randomly assigned to one of three **match ratios**:\n",
        "  - **1:1** — Every $1 donated is matched with $1.\n",
        "  - **2:1** — Every $1 donated is matched with $2.\n",
        "  - **3:1** — Every $1 donated is matched with $3.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additional randomization dimensions included:\n",
        "- **Maximum matching grant size**: $25,000, $50,000, $100,000, or unspecified.\n",
        "- **Suggested donation amount**: Equal to, 1.25×, or 1.5× of the individual’s previous highest donation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key findings from the study:\n",
        "- Mentioning a matching grant **increased donation response rate by 22%** and **revenue per solicitation by 19%**.\n",
        "- Surprisingly, **higher match ratios (2:1, 3:1) did not yield significantly greater giving** than the 1:1 match.\n",
        "- **Heterogeneous treatment effects** were found—donors in “red states” (those that voted for George W. Bush in 2004) responded significantly more to the matching grant than those in “blue states”.\n",
        "\n",
        "This experiment provides robust evidence for the effectiveness of matching grants in charitable giving and raises important questions about donor psychology, price sensitivity, and the contextual framing of donation requests.\n",
        "\n",

        "In the histogram for **sample size = 50**, zero is approximately in the **middle** of the distribution, which means that with small samples, it’s difficult to distinguish whether the treatment has a meaningful effect—the distribution is too wide, and zero is a plausible average difference just by chance.\n",

        "As the **sample size increases** to 200, 500, and especially 1000, zero moves toward the **tails** of the distribution. This suggests that with more data, the sample differences become more precise and center more tightly around the **true mean difference** (0.004), making it less likely that the observed effect is due to chance. At large sample sizes, **zero is no longer a likely value**, reinforcing confidence that the treatment has a small but real effect.\n"
