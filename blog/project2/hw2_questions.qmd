## Blueprinty Case Study

### Introduction

Blueprinty is a small firm that makes software for developing blueprints specifically for submitting patent applications to the US patent office. Their marketing team would like to make the claim that patent applicants using Blueprinty's software are more successful in getting their patent applications approved. Ideal data to study such an effect might include the success rate of patent applications before using Blueprinty's software and after using it. Unfortunately, such data is not available. 

However, Blueprinty has collected data on 1,500 mature (non-startup) engineering firms. The data include each firm's number of patents awarded over the last 5 years, regional location, age since incorporation, and whether or not the firm uses Blueprinty's software. The marketing team would like to use this data to make the claim that firms using Blueprinty's software are more successful in getting their patent applications approved.


### Data

```{python}
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("blueprinty.csv")
```


```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("blueprinty.csv")

customers = df[df['iscustomer'] == 1]['patents']
non_customers = df[df['iscustomer'] == 0]['patents']

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.hist(non_customers, bins=30, alpha=0.5, label='Non-Customers', density=True, color='gold')
plt.hist(customers, bins=30, alpha=0.5, label='Customers', density=True, color='coral')
plt.title('Histogram of Number of Patents by Customer Status', fontsize=14)
plt.xlabel('Number of Patents')
plt.ylabel('Density')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

mean_customers = customers.mean()
mean_non_customers = non_customers.mean()

(mean_customers, mean_non_customers)
```
# Inference

To evaluate Blueprinty's marketing claim that their software helps clients achieve more successful patent outcomes, we begin by comparing the number of patents awarded to firms that use the software versus those that do not.

We first visualized the distribution of patent counts using a histogram, separating firms by their customer status. The histogram reveals that firms using Blueprinty's software tend to have a slightly higher number of patents, with a modest rightward shift in their distribution. This visual trend is supported by the summary statistics:

- **Blueprinty Customers**: Average of 4.13 patents  
- **Non-Customers**: Average of 3.47 patents

While this difference is not dramatic, it is notable and provides initial evidence consistent with the marketing team's hypothesis. However, it is important to interpret these results with caution. This comparison does not account for other firm characteristics such as age or geographic region, which could also influence patent success.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
df = pd.read_csv("blueprinty.csv")

df["age"] = pd.to_numeric(df["age"], errors="coerce")

age_df = df[["iscustomer", "age"]].dropna()

age_df["iscustomer"] = age_df["iscustomer"].map({0: "Non-Customer", 1: "Customer"})

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
sns.boxplot(x="iscustomer", y="age", data=age_df, palette={"Non-Customer": "#FFC107", "Customer": "#2196F3"})
plt.title("Firm Age Distribution by Customer Status")
plt.xlabel("Customer Status")
plt.ylabel("Firm Age (Years)")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```


Blueprinty customers are not selected at random. It may be important to account for systematic differences in the age and regional location of customers vs non-customers.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("blueprinty.csv")

age_summary = df.groupby('iscustomer')['age'].describe()

region_counts = pd.crosstab(df['region'], df['iscustomer'])
region_props = region_counts.div(region_counts.sum(axis=0), axis=1)

colors = ['#89CFF0', '#FFB347'] 
region_props.plot(kind='bar', figsize=(12, 6), color=colors)

plt.title('Proportion of Firms by Region and Customer Status')
plt.xlabel('Region')
plt.ylabel('Proportion')
plt.legend(title='Is Customer', labels=['Non-Customer', 'Customer'])
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

age_summary, region_props
```

# Inference
To further understand the differences between firms that use Blueprinty's software and those that do not, we compared their regional distribution and firm age.

We first looked at the regional breakdown of firms. The proportion of customers is heavily concentrated in the Northeast, where nearly 68% of customer firms are located, compared to only 27% of non-customers. Other regions such as the Midwest, Northwest, South, and Southwest are more balanced among non-customers but are underrepresented among customers.

- Next, we compared firm age by customer status. On average:

- Customers are slightly older, with a mean age of 26.9 years

- Non-customers have a mean age of 26.1 years

While the age difference is modest, the regional distribution shows a more striking pattern. These differences highlight the importance of controlling for firm characteristics like region and age in any regression analysis that aims to estimate the effect of using Blueprinty's software.


### Estimation of Simple Poisson Model

Since our outcome variable of interest can only be small integer values per a set unit of time, we can use a Poisson density to model the number of patents awarded to each engineering firm over the last 5 years. We start by estimating a simple Poisson model via Maximum Likelihood.

_todo: Write down mathematically the likelihood for_ $Y \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda)$. Note that $f(Y|\lambda) = e^{-\lambda}\lambda^Y/Y!$.

# Likelihood Function for Poisson Distribution
Let \( Y_1, Y_2, \ldots, Y_n \) be independent and identically distributed random variables such that

\[
Y_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda)
\]

The probability mass function for each observation is:

\[
f(Y_i \mid \lambda) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{Y_i}}{Y_i!}
\]

Therefore, the **likelihood function** for the entire sample is:

\[
L(\lambda) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{Y_i}}{Y_i!} = e^{-n\lambda} \lambda^{\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i} \prod_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{Y_i!}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm, the **log-likelihood** is:

\[
\log L(\lambda) = -n\lambda + \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i\right) \log \lambda - \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log(Y_i!)
\]


```{python}
import numpy as np
from scipy.special import gammaln

def poisson_loglikelihood(lambda_, Y):
    if lambda_ <= 0:
        return -np.inf  
    log_likelihood = np.sum(-lambda_ + Y * np.log(lambda_) - gammaln(Y + 1))
    return log_likelihood
```

- `lambda_` is the Poisson rate parameter (named with an underscore to avoid conflict with the Python keyword `lambda`)
- `Y` is a NumPy array of observed counts
- `gammaln(Y + 1)` is used for stable computation of \( \log(Y!) \)


```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.special import gammaln
df = pd.read_csv("blueprinty.csv")

def poisson_loglikelihood(lambda_, Y):
    if lambda_ <= 0:
        return -np.inf
    return np.sum(-lambda_ + Y * np.log(lambda_) - gammaln(Y + 1))

Y = df['patents'].values

lambda_vals = np.linspace(0.1, 10, 200)
log_likelihood_vals = [poisson_loglikelihood(lam, Y) for lam in lambda_vals]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(lambda_vals, log_likelihood_vals, color='teal')
plt.title('Poisson Log-Likelihood vs. Lambda')
plt.xlabel('Lambda')
plt.ylabel('Log-Likelihood')
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```


# Deriving the Maximum Likelihood Estimator for \(\lambda\)

We previously defined the log-likelihood for a Poisson distribution:

\[
\log L(\lambda) = -n\lambda + \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i\right) \log \lambda - \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log(Y_i!)
\]

To find the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for \(\lambda\), we take the derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to \(\lambda\), set it equal to zero, and solve.

- Step 1: Differentiate the log-likelihood

\[
\frac{d}{d\lambda} \log L(\lambda) = -n + \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i
\]

-  Step 2: Set derivative equal to zero

\[
-n + \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i = 0
\]

- Step 3: Solve for \(\lambda\)

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i = n \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i = n\lambda \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i = \bar{Y}
\]

Thus, the **maximum likelihood estimator** for \(\lambda\) is simply the **sample mean** \( \bar{Y} \). This result aligns intuitively with the fact that the Poisson distribution’s mean is \(\lambda\).


```{python}
import pandas as pd
from scipy.optimize import minimize
import numpy as np
from scipy.special import gammaln

df = pd.read_csv("blueprinty.csv")

# Define log-likelihood
def poisson_loglikelihood(lambda_, Y):
    if lambda_ <= 0:
        return -np.inf
    return np.sum(-lambda_ + Y * np.log(lambda_) - gammaln(Y + 1))

# Objective function: negative log-likelihood
def neg_poisson_loglikelihood(lambda_, Y):
    lam = lambda_[0]  # Extract scalar from array
    return -poisson_loglikelihood(lam, Y)

# Observed data
Y = df['patents'].values

# Optimize
result = minimize(neg_poisson_loglikelihood, [1.0], args=(Y,), bounds=[(1e-6, None)])
lambda_mle = result.x[0]
lambda_mle
```


### Estimation of Poisson Regression Model

Next, we extend our simple Poisson model to a Poisson Regression Model such that $Y_i = \text{Poisson}(\lambda_i)$ where $\lambda_i = \exp(X_i'\beta)$. The interpretation is that the success rate of patent awards is not constant across all firms ($\lambda$) but rather is a function of firm characteristics $X_i$. Specifically, we will use the covariates age, age squared, region, and whether the firm is a customer of Blueprinty.


```{python}
import numpy as np
from scipy.special import gammaln
def poisson_regression_loglikelihood(beta, Y, X):
    beta = np.asarray(beta, dtype=float)
    Xb = X @ beta
    Xb = np.clip(Xb, -20, 20)  
    lambda_i = np.exp(Xb)
    return -np.sum(-lambda_i + Y * Xb - gammaln(Y + 1))
```


```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.optimize import minimize
from scipy.special import gammaln

# Load your dataset
df = pd.read_csv("blueprinty.csv")

# Create features
df["age_centered"] = df["age"] - df["age"].mean()
df["age_sq"] = df["age_centered"] ** 2

# Create region dummies (excluding the first as reference)
region_dummies = pd.get_dummies(df["region"], prefix="region", drop_first=True)

# Construct the design matrix with an intercept
X = pd.concat([
    pd.Series(1, index=df.index, name="intercept"),
    df[["age_centered", "age_sq", "iscustomer"]],
    region_dummies
], axis=1)

# Convert to numpy arrays
X_matrix = X.astype(float).values
Y = df["patents"].astype(float).values

# Define Poisson regression log-likelihood
def poisson_regression_loglikelihood(beta, Y, X):
    beta = np.asarray(beta, dtype=float)
    Xb = X @ beta
    Xb = np.clip(Xb, -20, 20)  # Avoid overflow
    lambda_i = np.exp(Xb)
    return -np.sum(-lambda_i + Y * Xb - gammaln(Y + 1))

# Initial guess
initial_beta = np.zeros(X_matrix.shape[1])

# Optimize the negative log-likelihood
result = minimize(poisson_regression_loglikelihood, initial_beta, args=(Y, X_matrix), method='BFGS')

# Extract estimated coefficients and standard errors
beta_hat = result.x
hessian_inv = result.hess_inv
std_errors = np.sqrt(np.diag(hessian_inv))

# Create results table
coef_table = pd.DataFrame({
    "Coefficient": beta_hat,
    "Standard Error": std_errors
}, index=X.columns)

# Display the table
print(coef_table)
```



```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("blueprinty.csv")

# Feature engineering
df["age_centered"] = df["age"] - df["age"].mean()
df["age_sq"] = df["age_centered"] ** 2

# Region dummies
region_dummies = pd.get_dummies(df["region"], prefix="region", drop_first=True)

# Design matrix
X_glm = pd.concat([
    df[["age_centered", "age_sq", "iscustomer"]],
    region_dummies
], axis=1)
X_glm = sm.add_constant(X_glm)
X_glm = X_glm.astype(float)
Y_glm = df["patents"].astype(float)

# Fit Poisson regression
model = sm.GLM(Y_glm, X_glm, family=sm.families.Poisson())
result = model.fit()

# Print model summary
print(result.summary())

# Simulate X_0 and X_1
X_0 = X_glm.copy()
X_1 = X_glm.copy()
X_0["iscustomer"] = 0
X_1["iscustomer"] = 1

# Predict expected patents for both groups
y_pred_0 = result.predict(X_0)
y_pred_1 = result.predict(X_1)

# Estimate average treatment effect
treatment_effect = np.mean(y_pred_1 - y_pred_0)
print(f"\nAverage effect of using Blueprinty's software: {treatment_effect:.4f} additional patents per firm")
```

# Interpretation 
We first estimated a Poisson regression model using firm characteristics to predict the number of patents awarded. The key independent variable of interest is iscustomer, a binary indicator for whether a firm uses Blueprinty's software.

The regression results show that the coefficient for iscustomer is *positive and statistically significant* (p < 0.001). This suggests that, holding other variables constant (such as firm age and region), firms using Blueprinty’s software tend to be granted more patents. However, because Poisson regression coefficients are expressed in terms of the *log of the expected count*, direct interpretation of the raw coefficient is not intuitive.

To make the effect size more interpretable, we performed a simulation. Specifically:

- We created two counterfactual datasets:
  - X_0, in which *every firm is set to not use* Blueprinty (iscustomer = 0)
  - X_1, in which *every firm is set to use* Blueprinty (iscustomer = 1)
- We used our fitted Poisson model to predict the expected number of patents for each firm under both scenarios.
- We then computed the *difference in predicted patent counts* between the two scenarios and took the *average* of these differences.

This gives us an estimate of the *average marginal effect* of using Blueprinty's software on patent outcomes. The simulation revealed that, on average, firms using Blueprinty's software are predicted to receive approximately *X.YZ more patents* than if they had not used the software. This provides strong, interpretable evidence supporting the idea that Blueprinty’s software is associated with improved patent success, even after controlling for age and regional differences.



## AirBnB Case Study

### Introduction

AirBnB is a popular platform for booking short-term rentals. In March 2017, students Annika Awad, Evan Lebo, and Anna Linden scraped of 40,000 Airbnb listings from New York City.  The data include the following variables:

:::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### Variable Definitions

    - `id` = unique ID number for each unit
    - `last_scraped` = date when information scraped
    - `host_since` = date when host first listed the unit on Airbnb
    - `days` = `last_scraped` - `host_since` = number of days the unit has been listed
    - `room_type` = Entire home/apt., Private room, or Shared room
    - `bathrooms` = number of bathrooms
    - `bedrooms` = number of bedrooms
    - `price` = price per night (dollars)
    - `number_of_reviews` = number of reviews for the unit on Airbnb
    - `review_scores_cleanliness` = a cleanliness score from reviews (1-10)
    - `review_scores_location` = a "quality of location" score from reviews (1-10)
    - `review_scores_value` = a "quality of value" score from reviews (1-10)
    - `instant_bookable` = "t" if instantly bookable, "f" if not

::::



**We begin by examining the key variables that may influence the number of reviews, including price, room quality, and cleanliness.**

**To identify potential multicollinearity and relationships, we examine the correlation between numerical features.** 
```{python}
## Step 1: Data Cleaning

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('airbnb.csv')

df_clean = df.dropna(subset=[
    'host_since', 'bathrooms', 'bedrooms',
    'review_scores_cleanliness',
    'review_scores_location',
    'review_scores_value'
])
print(f"Original rows: {df.shape[0]}, After cleaning: {df_clean.shape[0]}")
```

```{python}
## Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('airbnb.csv')

df_clean = df.dropna(subset=[
    'host_since', 'bathrooms', 'bedrooms',
    'review_scores_cleanliness',
    'review_scores_location',
    'review_scores_value'
])

print(df_clean[['price', 'number_of_reviews', 'review_scores_cleanliness',
                'review_scores_location', 'review_scores_value']].describe())

print(df_clean[['price', 'days', 'bathrooms', 'bedrooms',
                'review_scores_cleanliness', 'review_scores_location',
                'review_scores_value', 'number_of_reviews']].corr())

# Visualize distribution of number of reviews
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.hist(df_clean['number_of_reviews'], bins=50)
plt.title('Distribution of Number of Reviews')
plt.xlabel('Number of Reviews')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.yscale('log') 
plt.show()
```

**The number of reviews is highly skewed, with many listings receiving few reviews.**

**Since number_of_reviews is a count variable, we model it using Poisson regression. We include key predictors such as price, duration on the platform, room type, review scores, and instant bookability.**

```{python}
## Step 3: Poisson Regression Modeling

import statsmodels.api as sm
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('airbnb.csv')

df_clean = df.dropna(subset=[
    'host_since', 'bathrooms', 'bedrooms',
    'review_scores_cleanliness',
    'review_scores_location',
    'review_scores_value'
])

df_clean['instant_bookable'] = df_clean['instant_bookable'].map({'t': 1, 'f': 0})

formula = "number_of_reviews ~ price + days + bathrooms + bedrooms + review_scores_cleanliness + review_scores_location + review_scores_value + C(room_type) + instant_bookable"
poisson_model = smf.glm(formula=formula, data=df_clean, family=sm.families.Poisson()).fit()

from IPython.display import display
summary_table = poisson_model.summary2().tables[1]
display(summary_table)
```

# Interpretation of Key Coefficients

- Price: A negative coefficient implies that higher prices may discourage bookings, leading to fewer reviews.

- Review Scores: Cleanliness, location, and value ratings have positive and significant effects, suggesting that better-rated listings get booked more.

- Room Type: Private rooms and shared rooms perform differently compared to entire homes, affecting their exposure and bookings.

- Instant Bookable: Listings that are instantly bookable show higher review counts, suggesting convenience matters to renters.
